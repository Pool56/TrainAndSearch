## Project summary
The summary is that we are addressing the fact that basic necessities like clean water and opportunities in education are not equally accessible to all people. We are tackling the challenge of  education by creating learning materials which could be accessed without the internet to marginalised communities. We are using watsonx to do things such as:
Document analysis. We have  used watsonx.ai to extract key insights from courses in IBM SkillsBuild as well as IBM webinars and common questions and answers from a corpus of data related to resources or opportunities, and use that to better inform the local community.
For any of the generative AI models built and implemented using watsonx.ai for the document we made, we utilised  watsonx.governance to monitor and govern the projectâ€™s  compliance in relation to copyright infringement. 
We are  tackling clean water access by aiding water engineers with combining ESG reports from IBM software such as Maximo with  software such as IBM Cognos Analytics for easening analysis of drilling operations of water boreholes as well as water treatment in harsh environments such as  arid areas.
We are using watsonx to do things such as:
Event-based analysis. For example, you using  watsonx.ai to augment public data and weather data and assess the potential impacts of events, like climate disasters such as occurence of  floods and temperature levels by use of the Environmental Intelligence Suite and pollution by use scope emissions from the IBM Envizi.
Conversation intelligence. With watsonx.ai, watsonx Assistant,watsonx.orchestrate  local community conversations such as salinity (amount of salt in water) can be synthesized into concise summaries by use of IBM Cognos analytics, identifying key elements for efficient, personalized follow-ups and next best actions. The next best actions are determined by water engineers who derive insights from vast amount of data with regard to contents of water as well as weather patterns.

### The issue we are hoping to solve
The first issue we are hoping to solve is that people who are affected by climate change  such as drought or floods lack finances to buy phones or even access the internet so as learn various information such as certification courses. Moreover, visually impaired people are significantly affected as they are unable to effectively learn. The second issue we seek to solve is that water engineers who either drill  water boreholes or engage in activities such as water purification have their operations affected by climate change. This could be due to carbon emissions from industries or high temperature which could affect drilling equipment for water boreholes.

### How our technology solution can help
Using generative AI to create updated and accessible  offline content.


### Our idea
   The idea for quality education starts with gathering information from certification courses of IBM SkillsBuild, IBM website  and webinars from the IBM events website. 
The first  step would be to use watsonx.ai to generate new text then use watsonx.governance to examine possibility of bias and copyright infringement. The second  step would be placing the generated content in  PowerPoint documents then sending them to people who could use them. Alternatively, the documents could be uploaded to the chat mode of the Watsonx. ai so as to ground responses based on the contents of the documents.
We are also addressing the challenge of inequality by assisting the visually impaired to access online content more efficiently by use of plastic cards which function similar to braille  by using the lines and words engraved into plastic materials which illustrate content such as diagrams in the IBM SkillsBuild.
We have placed powerpoint documents of the courses which we have made in the docs folder. We used Watsonx.ai to generate new text by either use of simple english or fine tuning the AI model to create new text based on career of person such as engineering or agriculture.
The idea for clean water access also relies on the generated content from a course of titled Fundamentals of sustainability and Technology which outlines use of IBM ESG software such as Envizi.
The first step would be to acquire  information obtained from using ESG software such as Maximo and the Environmental Intelligence Suite ,the information obtained could be details such as health score or numbers of failures.
The information is then placed into excel documents by utilizing watsonx.ai and watsonx.orchestrate. 
The Watsonx. ai is used to add relevant content in the Add knowledge section of the Watsonx. Orchestrate so as to ground the  AI model with detailed information to use for its responses. 
The watsonx. Orchestrate is used automate the data entry process from information obtained from the  software such as Maximo and Environmental Intelligence Suite. This is accomplished by use of the AI assistant builder. 
Finally, the excel document is then uploaded to the IBM Cognos analytics so as to derive insights. These insights could be utilized by a water engineer especially on factors that affect water purification such as carbon emissions.
Moreover,  information derived from the Environmental Intelligence Suite concerning geospatial data outlines occurrences of  earthquakes  which significantly  aids in planning of drilling  operations of  water boreholes. 
Information obtained from Maximo application suite such as probability of   failure once summarized by the IBM Cognos analytics could  be essential  in conducting efficient maintenance schedules as high temperature due to climate change often leads increased tendencies of thermal stress of drilling equipment.
We have placed excel documents  we used for assessment in the docs secton which we uploaded into the IBM Cognos analytics.
